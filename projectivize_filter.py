"""
Projectivize Filter
(document_filters.cc)

Check whether the given sentence is projective or not.

Return value is whether the sentence was originally projective or not.
  - If it wasn't, return False
  - If it was, return True

projectivize parameter: whether or not to fix sentence to be projective
(does not affect return value)
